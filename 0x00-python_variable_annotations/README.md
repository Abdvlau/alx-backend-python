Why Variable Annotations?
Variable annotations in Python provide a way to associate type information with variables, which can enhance code readability, maintainability, and can assist with static type checking tools like mypy.

Key Benefits:

Type Safety:
Variable annotations help ensure that variables are used with the correct type, reducing bugs and improving the reliability of your code.

Code Readability:
Annotations make it clear what types of values are expected, making the code easier to understand for yourself and others.

Tooling Support:
Static type checkers and IDEs can use type annotations to provide better autocompletion, linting, and error checking, improving the overall development experience.
